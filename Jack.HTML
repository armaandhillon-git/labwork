<h1>Meet Jack</h1>
    <img src="http://www.htmliseasy.com/exercises/jack.gif" alt="Meet Jack">
<p>This is jack. Hes an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday.
    He may look happy, but hes a little disapointed. Now he will have to put a few things in the box.
</p>
<br>
<p>Jack would really like...
    <ul>
        <li>Roller blades</li>
        <li>Magic tricks</li>
        <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
        <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones are <a href="toysrus.com">toysrus.com</a> 
    and <a href="eToys.com">eToys.com</a>.
